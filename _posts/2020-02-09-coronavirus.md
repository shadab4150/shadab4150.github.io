## Context


* From World Health Organization - On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. 
* The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people.

* So daily level information on the affected people can give some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community.

* Johns Hopkins University has made an excellent dashboard using the affected cases data. 
* This data is extracted from the same link and made available in csv format.

## Dataset

* This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. 
* Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.

* **The data is available from 20 March, 2020.**
