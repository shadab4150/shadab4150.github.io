#### In this project I tried building a model which can predict a students grades.

* Based on fators such as alcohol cosumption, internet use, romantic life, parental status, family size.

* Dataset was downloaded from **UCI machine learning repository.**
* For full project overview and jupyter notebooks click here. [**Link**](https://github.com/shadab4150/Student-records-analysis-and-Predicting-Final-score)

### Below are some predicted scores plotted on graph to see comparison.

* Linear regress has least **RMSE** of 1.4
