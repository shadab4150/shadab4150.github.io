![kd](https://i.ibb.co/Yptm4k7/mura.jpg)


### MURA **(musculoskeletal radiographs)** is a large dataset of bone X-rays of seven body parts.

### Objective:
* **To build  an image classifier that can distinguish between Normal and Abnormal bone Deformaties by seeing the X-Ray images.**

### Project Notebooks
* [**Data Preparation Notebook**](https://github.com/shadab4150/Mura-Stanford-Bone-Xray-abnormalities-detection/blob/master/file_processing_mura_stanford_bone_abnormalities_.ipynb)


* [**Model Training Notebook**](https://github.com/shadab4150/Mura-Stanford-Bone-Xray-abnormalities-detection/blob/master/mura_stanford_bone_abnormalities_kappa.ipynb)



**MURA is one of the largest public radiographic image datasets offered by Stanford University.**



## Dataset:
* To obtain the dataset please contact [**StanfordMLGroup**](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/) or email them. They will send a download link along with a **Research Use Agreement** contract form.
