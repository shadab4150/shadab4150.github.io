# A  tutorial for beginners on to how to make a classifer that classifies between 104 types of flowers.

## Dataset :
* Can be downloaded from [**here**](https://www.kaggle.com/ianmoone0617/flower-goggle-tpu-classification)

* In  this tutorial I will teach you how to build a deep learning neural network from scratch with **fast.ai** it's like **keras** but for pytorch and a lot more simpler.

* Click the below notebook for the Tutorial.
