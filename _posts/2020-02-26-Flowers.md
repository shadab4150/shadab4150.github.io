# A  tutorial for beginners on to how to make a classifer that classifies between 104 types of flowers.

## Dataset :
* Can be downloaded from [**here**](https://www.kaggle.com/ianmoone0617/flower-goggle-tpu-classification)

* In  this tutorial I will teach you how to build a deep learning neural network from scratch with **fast.ai**.
* It's like **keras** but for pytorch and a lot more simpler.

* Click the below notebook for the Tutorial.

### [**Tutorial Notebook**](https://shadab4150.github.io/Deep-Learning-Classifiers/104_flowers_classification.html)

## You can even run it on **Kaggle** without any hassels just in one click from my kernel. Please upvote if you like on kaggle. 

* From making a model to submission on kaggle.
* Just click the kaggle link below. Upon reaching kaggle click on top right corner  button of **copy-edit**.
* Run every cell in kaggle and your model is ready. 
* If you want to experiment try changing some values see what effects it has on the model.
